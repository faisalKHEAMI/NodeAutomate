# NodeAutomate
Made this app because to automate the start/kill of my node on my remote server 
# Server Node Kill - SSH Manager

This Python application uses `Paramiko` to manage SSH connections to an EC2 instance and `PySimpleGUI` to create a simple 
GUI for monitoring and managing Node.js processes. The app can connect to a remote EC2 server, check if any Node.js 
processes are running, kill the second process if found, and start a Node.js application.

## Features
- **SSH Connection**: Establishes an SSH connection to a specified EC2 instance using a `.pem` private key.
- **Node.js Process Monitoring**: Checks if Node.js processes are running on the server.
- **Process Management**: Kills the second Node.js process if multiple instances are found.(First node is the server's node)
- **Node.js Application Startup**: Starts a Node.js application on the remote server.
- **Simple GUI**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to connect, monitor, and manage processes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `paramiko` library for SSH connections
- `PySimpleGUI` library for the GUI interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/faisalkheami/nodeAutomate

2. Install dependencies:
    pip install paramiko pysimplegui


3. Ensure that your SSH private key (e.g., `.pem` file) is stored on your machine. Update the `key_path` in the script to point to this key.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:
    python server_node_kill.py
or try
    python3
   
3. A GUI will appear prompting you to enter the EC2 server's IP address. The default is set to `3-19-27-169`.

4. Click **Connect** to establish the SSH connection.

5. The app will check for any running Node.js processes:
   - If found, it will display the PIDs of the running processes and kill the second one (if applicable).
   - If not found, it will display a message indicating that no processes are running.

6. Click **Disconnect** to close the SSH connection.

## Running on Windows

### Ensure the following steps are completed:

- Update the `key_path` to the correct path for your SSH key. Use raw string notation for Windows file paths, e.g.:

    key_path = r'C:\path\to\your\website.pem'


- Ensure that **OpenSSH Client** is installed on your Windows machine. You can install it via **Settings > Apps > Optional Features**.

- To run the script:

    python server_node_kill.py
or try
    python3

### Optional: Create an Executable

If you'd like to create a standalone executable for easier distribution on Windows:

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile server_node_kill.py
This will generate an .exe file that you can run without needing Python installed.

Troubleshooting
SSH Connection Issues: Ensure your EC2 instance is reachable and that your .pem key file has the correct permissions.
Node.js Not Found: Ensure Node.js is installed and running on your EC2 instance.
Firewalls: Ensure Windows firewall or network settings donâ€™t block outbound SSH connections.
